this is a test file just to check integration
first of all i installed github plugin in jenkins
then installed git in local server(amazon-linux server) it automatically added path for git in global tool config of jenkins
now i created a job in jenkins and adding this repsoitory url (https)
then i will check whether this is integrated or not by checking this repo in local server
editing just to check build triggers in jenkins...
